# Adder and Subtractor Circuit

# Op-Amp Circuit Design: Part (b)

This design implements the output function:

y₂(t) = 2x₂(t) + 6x₃(t)

## 1. Circuit Topology

Since all coefficients are positive, we use a Non-Inverting Summing Amplifier. This configuration allows us to sum the inputs and apply gain without inverting the signal phase.

### Schematic Requirements

- Op-Amp: Standard (e.g., LM741 or TL081)
- Supply Voltage (VCC): ±15 V
- Input Stage: A resistive summing network connected to the non-inverting (+) terminal.
- Gain Stage: A standard non-inverting feedback loop.

## 2. Component Selection

To achieve the specific weights of 2 and 6, we calculate the resistor values based on the non-inverting summing formula:

Vout = (1 + Rf/Rg) × ((V₁R₂ + V₂R₁)/(R₁ + R₂))

| Component | Label | Value | Description |
|------------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Resistor 1 | R₂ | 30 kΩ | Connected to input x₂(t) |
| Resistor 2 | R₃ | 10 kΩ | Connected to input x₃(t) |
| Feedback Resistor | Rf | 70 kΩ | Connected between Output and Inverting (-) pin |
| Gain Resistor | Rg | 10 kΩ | Connected between Inverting (-) pin and Ground |

## 3. Mathematical Verification

### Step 1: Voltage at Non-Inverting Pin (V+)

Using the voltage divider principle between the two inputs:

V+ = [x₂(t)·10k + x₃(t)·30k] / (10k + 30k)

V+ = (10/40)x₂(t) + (30/40)x₃(t)

V+ = 0.25x₂(t) + 0.75x₃(t)

### Step 2: Amplifier Gain (Av)

The gain of the non-inverting stage is determined by Rf and Rg:

Av = 1 + Rf/Rg

Av = 1 + 70k/10k

Av = 8

### Step 3: Final Output (y₂)

y₂(t) = Av × V+

y₂(t) = 8 × [0.25x₂(t) + 0.75x₃(t)]

y₂(t) = 2x₂(t) + 6x₃(t)

## 4. Operation Limits

Given the input values:

x₂(t) = 0.5 sin(2000πt) (Peak ±0.5 V)

x₃(t) = +1 V

Maximum Peak Output:

y₂,max = 2(0.5) + 6(1) = 7 V

Since 7 V is well within the ±15 V supply rails, the op-amp will operate in its linear region without clipping.

# Working Principle: Non-Inverting Summing Amplifier

The Non-Inverting Summing Amplifier works by combining multiple input signals into a single voltage and then amplifying that combined signal without changing its polarity (phase).

It operates in two distinct stages:

## 1. Passive Summing Stage (The "Mixer")

In this stage, the input voltages (x₁, x₂, ... xn) are connected to the Non-Inverting (+) Terminal through a network of resistors.

- No Current Flow: Because an ideal op-amp has infinite input impedance, no current flows into the (+) terminal.
- Weighted Average: The resistors form a voltage divider. The voltage at the (+) pin becomes a weighted average of all inputs.
- Phase Preservation: Since the signals enter the (+) terminal, a positive increase in input results in a positive increase in output.

## 2. Active Amplification Stage (The "Booster")

Once the inputs are mixed at the (+) terminal, the op-amp acts as a standard Non-Inverting Amplifier.

- Negative Feedback: Resistors Rf (feedback) and Rg (ground) create a feedback loop to the Inverting (-) terminal.
- Voltage Follower Logic: The op-amp automatically adjusts its output so that the voltage at the (-) terminal matches the voltage at the (+) terminal.
- Gain Multiplication: The mixed voltage at the (+) terminal is multiplied by the gain:

Av = 1 + Rf/Rg

## 3. The Final Result

The output is the mathematical product of the Mixed Input and the Gain.

Vout = Gain × Weighted Average of Inputs

### Transient Analysis Report

The transient analysis (time-domain simulation) was performed to observe the circuit's response to a time-varying input x₂(t) combined with a constant DC offset from x₃(t).

### 2. Waveform Observations

- DC Offset (Center Line): The sine wave is centered at 6 V.
- Peak-to-Peak Amplitude: The wave fluctuates between 5 V and 7 V.
- Frequency: One full cycle every 1 ms, confirming 1 kHz operation.

### 3. Verification of the Design Equation
